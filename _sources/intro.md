# Lecture slides for Programming in Python BB1000

Welcome to the course!

This course is an introductory course in programming based on the Python
programming language.  It incorporates some of the best practices from
professional programming environments aimed at students in scientific and
technical fields.

No previous experience of programming is assumed, but you will find a steep
learning curve and will be exposed to various advanced topics not normally
covered in beginners' courses. However, the goal is not to make you a software
engineer, but to provide you with software skills that will make you work more
effectively in your own area of choice.

The course will be given by tutors with many years of programming experience in
various scientific areas.
